To Do Tasks:
  1. accurate collision physics [DONE]
  2. Find details on the following:
      - grade or incline angle of surfaces
      - obstacle density
      - verticle and horizontal area coverage
      - frequency of floor gaps and gap widths
      - minimum aperture size
  3. Add zones for ground differences above
  4. Add sensor details in the simulation
  5. Add distributed sensing [DONE]
Meeting Notes:
The goal is to 1. generate a baseline on power consumption required, 2. figure out optimal sensor split.
